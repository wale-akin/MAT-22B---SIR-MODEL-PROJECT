# MAT-22B---SIR-MODEL-PROJECT

These are the supporting files from my final project in Differential Equations (MAT 22B). It was a collaborative effort with my 2 other group members mentioned on the final pdf. The goal was to create a infectious disease tracker using the SIR model, which uses differential equartions to generate different plots over time as diffferent variables change.
